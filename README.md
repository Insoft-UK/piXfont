# Adafruit GFX Pixel Font Creator
This is a handy utility that goes well with the original [fontconvert](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/tree/master/fontconvert) tool provided by [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) for converting TTF fonts to Adafruit_GFX `.h` format.

This utility tool provides the ability to generate an Adafruit_GFX `.h` format from an image file.

> [!NOTE]
The only image file format currently supported by this utility tool is the Portable Bitmap (PBM) P4 format.
