# Adafruit GFX Pixel Font Creator

#### piXfont
- Creates an Adafruit GFX Pixel Font file from a given PBM P4 file.

This is a handy command line tool for creating Adafruit GFX font from a .pbm (Prtable Bitmap) image file.
This is useful since the the font you may wish to use is not a TTF file but an image file that contains the bitmap glyphs.
